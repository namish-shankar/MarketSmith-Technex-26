    <h2>Interface</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All registered players will be divided into groups of six.</li>
        <li>One common playing table will be shared among players of the group.</li>
        <li>All players on the table can view the current question along with the holdings and PnL of other players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Framework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Six digits (1-9) are generated at the start of each round.</li>
        <li>The digits remain unrevealed throughout the round.</li>
        <li>The PnL of every player at the start of the round will be set to zero.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Question Phase</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One question appears on the dashboard at the start of every turn.</li>
        <li>The correct answer corresponds to the digit for that turn.</li>
        <li>Players must keep answers to themselves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assets & Ownership</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The value of one asset equals the <strong>sum of all six digits</strong>.</li>
        <li>Each player starts with 2 assets.</li>
        <li>An additional asset is given after the third turn.</li>
        <li>There is no limit on maximum holdings per player.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Trading Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Players may quote bid and/or ask prices after solving the question in the 30-second window.</li>
        <li>The orders set by players must be of one asset.</li>
        <li>A trade is executed when bid and ask of two players are met.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Trading Logic & Execution Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the highest bid is less than the lowest ask, no trades will be executed.</li>
        <li>If the highest bid is higher than the lowest ask, trades will be executed following the rules similar to a stock exchange.</li>
        <li>Trades will be executed at the ask price (e.g. Bid : $35 and Ask : $32, then trade will be executed at $32).</li>
        <li>Orders are matched from best bid and best ask outward.</li>
        <li>In case of a tie, the player booking the order first will be given priority.</li>
        <li>No money is kept by the dealer (sum of all players’ PnL is always zero).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of Round</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>True asset value is revealed.</li>
        <li>Final wealth = PnL + asset valuation.</li>
        <li>Players are ranked by total profit.</li>
    </ul>
